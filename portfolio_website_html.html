              <p>
                Power outputs from solar panels or photovoltaic (PV) cells have
                previously been forecasted using weather data and data from
                large-scale photovoltaic plants. These models are primarily used
                for short-term forecasting ranging from a few minutes to a few
                days into the future. This project analyses the effects of
                weather features on power output and compares three different
                types of models: SARIMAX, XGBoost and LSTM-RNN, developed using
                UK weather data and power output data from a UK residential
                photovoltaic system. The models are used for longer-term
                forecasting of one-year of power outputs and compared using
                plots, RMSE, MAE and R2 . All weather features in the data were
                found to have significant correlations to the power outputs. The
                best performing model overall was the LSTM-RNN from the RMSE and
                MAE.
              </p>
              <p>
                The aim of this project was to build and evaluate commonly used
                PV power output forecasting techniques and suggest a model for
                multivariate, long-term forecasting of a UK residential PV
                system power output.
              </p>
              <p>
                The technical process followed during this project is outlined
                in Figure 1.

                The distributions for each variable were examined by the density
                plots and box plots shown in Figure 2. The Shapiro-Wilk test for
                normality was used alongside these visualisations to test if the
                target variable of <em>Monthly Power Generation (kWh)</em> had a
                normal distribution. The resulting p-value determined the target
                was not normally distributed.

                Therefore, Spearman’s correlation was used to test the
                correlations between the variables and the target, Figure 3.
                These relationships are plotted in Figure 4 and the Spearman’s

                From the correlations and the p-values, all the variables have
                significant correlations to the target, so are maintained for
                use in the models as exogenous features.
              </p>
              <p>
                Figure 5 shows the time series of the target (Monthly Power
                Generation), along with it’s rolling mean and rolling standard
                deviation. There appears to be a seasonal pattern as well as a
                downward trend in this data. To establish if the features and
                the target are stationary, each feature was decomposed, this is
                shown in Figure 6. Figure 6a, c, e, g and i show the plotted
                time series and b, d, f, h, and j show the corresponding
                decomposed variables. Again, the target (6a and 6b) shows a
                downward trend and seasonality. The Mean Monthly Temperature
                (6f) may have a slight upward trend. The other exogenous
                features do not show any clear trends. The features Sun Hours
                (6d), Mean Monthly Temperature (6f) and No. Frost Days (6j)
                display clear seasonal components.

                Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests were also performed on the
                exogenous features, the target, the differenced target, and the
                seasonally differenced target. The results from these showed the
                exogenous features to be stationary due to trend and the target
                to not be stationary. They also showed that differencing the
                target once and seasonally differencing the target once made the
                target stationary.
              </p>
              <p>
                ACF plots were also created for each exogenous feature to view
                autocorrelation. Figure 7a, c and d show clear correlations
                between the lags of the features: Sun Hours, No. Frost Days and
                Mean Monthly Temperature. Strong negative correlations at lag
                six can be seen for all these features and strong positive
                correlations can be seen at lag twelve. This shows the presence
                of a yearly season structure in the data. From Figure 7b and
                Figure 6h there appears to be no seasonal component or trend in
                the Rain mm feature.

                An ACF plot was also created for the detrended target to view
                how many data points the seasonal component repeats over. A peak
                outside of the blue region, greater than zero, at lag twelve
                means the values have statistically significant correlations to
                the observation twelve data points prior, indicating a yearly
                seasonal component.

                The data was split into a training set and testing set as shown

                data.

                Incorporate target lags and weather data to build three
                long-term, multivariate forecasting models: statistical, machine
                learning and deep learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                The three types of models were chosen to evaluate a wide range
                of forecasting methods. Lags of the target variable and weather
                data were used to train the models. This was done as previously
                some types of models, such as the XGB, had not been developed
                using previous power outputs, only using weather features.
                Additionally, these models are built for longer term predictions
                as opposed to one day-ahead forecasting. The review by Mellit et
                al. (2020) states few studies focus on long-term forecasting and
                expresses the need for its investigation.

                Pmdarima was used to find the orders of autoregressive and
                moving average parts of the SARIMAX model. A function was
                created to test different values of d and D which represent how
                many times the time series should be differenced or seasonally
                differenced to make it stationary, see Figure 10. The model that
                produced the lowest Akaike’s Information Criterion value was
                chosen to be the final model. The model was then evaluated using
                statsmodels plot_diagonstics summary functions.

                A second SARIMAX model was developed to evaluate if seasonal
                differencing of the exogenous features altered model performance
                or fit. Seasonal differencing was performed on the exogenous

                scikit-learn library was used for hyperparameter tuning and
                performance evaluation.
              </p>
              <p>
                One XGB model was built without prior normalisation of the data
                and another XGB model with normalisation. Feature scales can
                affect the predictions of XGB, so this comparison was performed
                to test the performance of the XGB model with and without
                normalisation.
              </p>
              <p>
                A function was created to frame the data as a supervised
                learning problem as to allow the lag data to be used with the
                XGB model, see Figure 11.

              <p>
                The LSTM-RNN was built using Pytorch. A function was created to
                display the data as tensors, see Figure 13. As feature scales
                can affect neural networks, functions were created to accept
                tensors, normalise or rescale the data, and return the data to
                the original tensor structure, see Figure 14.

              <p>
                The models were used to make predictions for the twelve-month
                period at the end of the dataset. The predictions from the
                models were compared using three performance metrics: RMSE, MAE
                and R2, the results of these are show in Table 2. The LSTM-RNN
                produced the best values for the RMSE and MAE and the
                second-best value for the R2, with the SARIMAX II model
                producing the best R2 result. The model predictions were also
                compared using visualisations. Figure 20 shows each of the
                predictions made by the models plotted next to the true power
                output values for that period. Both SARIMAX models and XGB model
                without normalisation have a similar pattern to their
                predictions that mimics the shape of the true values but
                overestimates the power outputs for the 04/23 – 06/23 and the
                08/23 months. Normalisation appears to stop the XGB model
                overestimating the power outputs. This model gives close
                estimates of power output up to the 06/23, then starts to
                underestimate. The LSTM-RNN model produces a curve to estimate
                the power output, following the pattern of the true values less
                closely than the other models, but gives more accurate
                predictions overall. Figure 21 shows linear regression for the
                predicted monthly power outputs compared against the true
                outputs. The R2 values, Table 2, correspond to these. The more
                accurate the model predictions, the closer the points lie to the
                line. Models appear to make better predictions when the true
                power output is low, these low power output values correspond to
                the winter months. However, the winter months for the test set
                lie the closest in time to the end of the training set, which
                may be causing there more accurate predictions. Future work
                could use different length horizon times for a model to evaluate
                whether winter months or values closer to the end of the
                training set are predicted more accurately.

                The data is organised in a denormalized model with embedded
                documents due to the one-to-many relationship of one site to
                many readings. One document contains the data for the site which
                includes the site id, site name and its geo location. Inside
                this, the document for the readings is embedded. The key
                readings contains an array for each reading for the site. This
                document was placed inside one collection called sites within
                the database. This approach was used over having one document
                for each reading and embedding the site data into each of these
                as this would cause much repetition of the site data. The
                denormalized model with embedded documents was used over the
                normalised model due to faster querying. As only one collection
                needs to be queried, results are returned faster. Also, with the
                normalised model, the documents for each site would contain
                large, potentially growing arrays of reading ids.

                The brief for this project was to create a classification tool
                for use by a company doing chemical analysis. They wished to
                know if they need to measure all variables, or if a subset of
                variables could achieve the same out-of-sample classification
                performance. Being able to use a subset of variables would mean
                faster processing times; but they would not wish to sacrifice
                classification performance for the sake of marginal speed gains.
              </p>
              <p>
                The data contained information on different chemicals and their
                classes. There were 20 numerical variables and one categorical
                variable representing the target variable.
              </p>
              <p>
                The report is created as a Quarto document and the exploratory
                data analysis and model development is written in R.

                The data was checked for missingness. Only 2% of the data was
                found to be missing, therefore only complete cases were used in
                EDA and model development.

              <p>
                The data was first split into training, test and validation sets
                with a split of 50% training, 25% test and 25% validation.

                Variable V14 with V13 and V17 appear to be strongly negatively
                correlated. Variable V17 and V15 also appear to be strongly
                negatively correlated. Variables V14 and V15 appear to have
                moderate positive correlation with each other. This means that
                there are possible relationships between the variables and means
                the dimensionality of the dataset can potentially be reduced
                using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

              <p>
                Performing parallel analysis prior to PCA showed that 5
                dimensions should be retained, as these had eigenvalues greater
                than one. This showed how much variation is being explained more
                than by chance, and so how many dimensions to retain to explain
                this variation. Table 1 shows the linear combination of the
                variables for each principal component created by the PCA. It
                shows the results of all 20 variables captured by 5 dimensions
                showing that we can still capture the same information from the
                observations but with fewer dimensions.

              <p>
                Principal component 1 is responsible for capturing the largest
                variation in the data. It shows a linear combination of the
                variables. The variables 13, 14, 15 and 17 are captured the most
                by principal component 1. The high negative correlation between
                variables 14 and 17 is captured here by showing that they have
                similar magnitudes in the opposite directions for their column
                normed scores. The high negative correlation between 17 and 15,
                and 13 and 14 are also captured by principal component 1, as
                well as the positive correlation between variables 14 and 15.
                These correlations were shown to be present in the original
                training dataset. This means that principal component 1 can
                represent the results covered by these variables and reduces the
                need for all four raw variables to be in the data. Principal
                component 2 captures variable 5 in one direction and variable 6
                in the other direction. Principal component 3 predominantly
                describes variable 18, and variable 12 to a slightly lesser
                extent in the opposite direction. Principal component 4 captures
                variable 4. It also captures variables 9, 3 and 7 to a lesser
                extent in the opposite direction. Principal component 5
                predominantly captures variable 1; also, variables 2 and 12 in
                the same direction and 11 and 5 in the opposite direction.

              <p>
                Five different classification models were trained and tested:
                Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), Model Based
                Discriminant Analysis (MBDA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
                and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA). Model performance was
                compared using the accuracy metric.
              </p>
              <p>
                Accuracy was chosen as it gives an overall representation of the
                performance of the model. The accuracy is calculated by the
                total number of correct predictions over the total number of
                observations.

              <p>
                Table 4 shows the best performing model to be the Random Forest
                model with an accuracy of 86.93% on the in-sample test data.
                This model had a much higher accuracy than the other models. The
                model also had a greater performance on the out-of-sample
                validation set, with an accuracy of 89.89%. This suggests that
                the Random Forest model is not overfitting the training data and
                demonstrates how it performs on unseen data. Due to the nature
                of the algorithm, the Random Forest model was performed on all
                features of the data, without prior PCA. Therefore, for optimal
                classification performance, the findings from this report
                suggest that all variables that were present in the original
                dataset should be measured and included and used in the Random
                Forest model.

                The data contains information on lifestyle factors and a
                category of obesity level calculated from body mass index (BMI)
                and the standards set out by the World Health Organization (WHO)
                and Mexican Normativity (Palechor and Manotas, 2019). The
                original researchers used a SMOTE method (Chawla et al., 2002)
                to balance the classes from the data collected. This resulted in
                77% of the data being synthetically generated. This was
                performed to allow the subsequent development of predictive

                Supervised learning algorithms were chosen for this problem as
                the goal is to classify the observations into one of seven
                categories. Five different algorithms were trained and tested
                for this classification problem. A grid search approach was used
                during hyperparameter tuning for the models, during which a
                five-fold cross validation was performed to analyse the
                performance of the model with each hyperparameter combination.
                The training set was used to train the models and the testing
                set was used to test and tune the hyperparameters. The
                validation set was not touched throughout this process to
                prevent data leakage. This set was saved to evaluate the
                performance of the best model using unseen data.

                The models with the hyperparameters that give the best
                performances were then tested using a ten-fold cross validation
                approach. Figure 4 and Table 3 show a comparison of the accuracy
                scores of the models. The standard deviations of the accuracy
                scores are shown in Table 3. Many of the models performed well
                with an accuracy score over 78%. The adaptive boosting model
                performed poorly compared to the other models with an accuracy
                score of 45%. The best performing model was the Random Forest
                model with an accuracy score of 86%, followed by the Gradient
                Boosting model with an accuracy score of 83%.

                The validation set was used to show the out-of-sample
                performance of the final Random Forest model. Table 4 shows the
                accuracy, weighted F1 score and the area under curve receiver
                operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) for the random forest model
                with the validation set. These scores show that the Random
                Forest model performs well. These scores show that the model is
                not likely to be overfitting the data as the model shows similar
                accuracy performance on the training and validation set

                Figure 5 shows the importance of each feature is in the Random
                Forest model. Age appears to be the most important feature,
                followed by frequency of vegetables eaten (FCVC), number of main
                meals (NCP), Time using Technology (TUE), consumption of water
                daily (CH2O) and physical activity frequency (FAF). To further
                develop the model, feature engineering could be performed. For
                example, selecting features based on a feature importance
                threshold to be included in the model, and comparing the
                performance of the model with all the feature to the model with
                the engineered features.
